The Hunger Games Simulator (Reloaded) is what was supposed to be a better and more intelligent version of BrantSteele.net's Hunger Games Simulator. Game works but isn't as smart as I would've wanted it to be.

Be free to do whatever you want with it as long as it is not for commercial use and as long as I am in the credited.
